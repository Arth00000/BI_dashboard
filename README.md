## Project Structure

### 1. Data Modeling

- **Objective**: Establish a structured data model to facilitate efficient analysis.
- **Steps**:
  - Identified key tables relevant to hotel operations, such as bookings, customer information, room details, and financial transactions.
  - Created relationships between tables to enable seamless data interaction and analysis.

### 2. Data Transformation

- **Objective**: Prepare the data for analysis by transforming it into a suitable format.
- **Tools Used**: Power Query Editor.
- **Steps**:
  - Applied various transformation techniques, including pivoting and unpivoting data, to reshape the dataset.
  - Merged multiple data sources to create a comprehensive dataset that reflects all relevant aspects of hotel operations.

### 3. Data Cleaning

- **Objective**: Ensure data integrity and accuracy for reliable insights.
- **Steps**:
  - Identified and removed duplicate records.
  - Handled missing values through appropriate imputation methods or removal, as necessary.
  - Standardized data formats (e.g., date and currency) to maintain consistency across the dataset.

### 4. Dashboard Creation

- **Objective**: Develop an interactive dashboard to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics.
- **Steps**:
  - Designed visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, and tables, to represent data insights effectively.
  - Implemented filters and slicers for dynamic data exploration, allowing users to view specific segments (e.g., time periods, room types).
  - Integrated key metrics such as occupancy rates, average daily rates (ADR), revenue per available room (RevPAR), and customer satisfaction scores.

## Conclusion

This Power BI dashboard project for hotel management serves as a comprehensive tool for visualizing and analyzing hotel performance. By leveraging data modeling, transformation, and cleaning processes, we have created a user-friendly interface that empowers hotel managers to make data-driven decisions and enhance operational efficiency.
